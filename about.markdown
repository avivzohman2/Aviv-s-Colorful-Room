This website serves as a digital repository for me to document what I am thinking, learning and building.   

I recently completed a master's in machine learning at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.mlmi.eng.cam.ac.uk/), where I focused on using language models to generate general-purpose programs using code-snippets provided in-context. Previously, I studied electrical engineering at UCLA.
